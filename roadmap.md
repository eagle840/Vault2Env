# Roadmap

## Must have

- add version output `v2e version`
- add option for device login `v2e login-with-devicecode`
- check user is logged in before pulled secret.
- should be a user .appsettings
- should be a pwd appsettings that overrdies default user
- should be a pwd json list of secrets to pull with a single command
  - that way when running a project, this command will pull all secrets needed.



## Nice to have

- allow for AWS and GCP
- in the app settings, set the default AZ account/subscription to use. Same for running v2e for a sepecific dir.

## Thoughts

- should the app be allowed to set secrets (no)
- show secret version
