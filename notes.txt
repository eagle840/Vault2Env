To run the application on a typical Windows computer that doesn't have the .NET runtime or the `dotnet` CLI installed, you'll need to publish your project as a self-contained executable. This means the compiled output will include the .NET runtime and all necessary dependencies, allowing it to run independently on the target machine.

Below are the steps to achieve this:

---

### **Step 1: Modify the Project (Optional)**

If you want a single-file executable (i.e., one .exe) rather than a folder with many files, you can update your project file (`.csproj`) to include these properties. Open your `KeyVaultDemo.csproj` file and include the following within a `<PropertyGroup>`:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <PublishSingleFile>true</PublishSingleFile>
  <SelfContained>true</SelfContained>
  <RuntimeIdentifier>win-x64</RuntimeIdentifier>
  <!-- Optionally, trim unused assemblies to decrease file size -->
  <PublishTrimmed>true</PublishTrimmed>
</PropertyGroup>
```

Alternatively, you can provide these properties as command-line parameters when you publish.

### **Step 2: Publish as a Self-Contained Application**

From your project directory, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true /p:PublishSingleFile=true
```

Let’s break down the command:

- **`-c Release`**: Publishes the application in the Release configuration.
- **`-r win-x64`**: Targets 64-bit Windows. If you need a 32-bit version, use `win-x86`.
- **`--self-contained true`**: Bundles the .NET runtime with your application.
- **`/p:PublishSingleFile=true`**: Packages everything into a single executable file.
- **`/p:PublishTrimmed=true`** *(optional)*: Trims unused code, which can reduce the file size but should be used carefully.

After running the command, you’ll find your executable in the `bin/Release/net9.0/win-x64/publish` directory.

---

### **Step 3: Deploy the Application**

Now that you have your self-contained executable, you can copy the published folder (or just the single `.exe` file, if you've used the single-file publish option) to any typical Windows computer. The program will run without requiring any pre-installed version of the .NET runtime.

### **Additional Considerations**

- **File Size:**  
  Self-contained and single-file options tend to produce larger executables since they include the runtime. If file size is a concern, you can consider not using the single-file option or explore compression options.

- **Testing:**  
  Always test the published executable on an environment that does not have the .NET runtime installed to ensure that all dependencies were correctly bundled.

- **Updating Your Application:**  
  For each new version of your application, you'll need to re-publish it with these settings, and then redistribute the executable to your users.

This self-contained deployment approach is especially useful when you want to distribute your application to environments where you cannot rely on the .NET runtime being present, giving your users a seamless experience without additional installations.
